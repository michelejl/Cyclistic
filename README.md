# Cyclistic

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The company wants to maximalize the number of annual memberships and therefore wants to understand how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

I used Excel, RStudio and Tableau in order to clean, manipulate and draw insights from the data. The files are attached.
